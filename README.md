# Start an IGV instance

The program will create a local webserver with IGV at `http://localhost:8000`, and will make the files in the folder you select available at `http://localhost:8001/`.
It will also automatically open an IGV instance in your preferred browser for convenience.

Once you are done, to terminate the webservers you can just close the terminal.
